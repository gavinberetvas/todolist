Local storage breaks the object methods so I need to add them on initialization?

TODO: local storage and 
      hardcoded filters: e.g. today, this week, important, completed.
      priority 
      completed button
      project object

      

e.g. projects {
  ID: 1234567890-98765432
  title: New_Project_1,

  and so on...
}

///For some reason the new notes made in the projcet folders dont get the correct UUID value. I need to fix that, and then Im basically done. 

//except important and completed still need to iterate through the library and sort by important: true and completed: true, but thats pretty straightforward.
